BEAVRS 2D GEOMETRY SPECIFICATION AND XS GENERATION FOR OPENMOC
==============================================================

Welcome to the BEAVRS 2D repository! BEAVRS is the Benchmark for
Evaluation And Validation of Reactor Simulations, a benchmark reactor
physics problem developed at MIT for validation of nuclear reactor 
physics codes like OpenMOC. The purpose of this repository is to provide 
the OpenMOC geometry and material cross section input for a 2D version 
of the BEAVRS problem. The material cross section libraries have been 
generated in 2 and 8 group form. Separate input files for all assemblies 
as well as the full core are included.
